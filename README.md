# Homework 3: Hangman Prep

## Due
Monday, October 19 at 11:59 PM

## Description
We've explored quite a bit with iOS development, and learned how to make simple apps. Continuing this trend, we are eventually going to make a full-on iOS Hangman game for our next project. This homework assignment is dealing with some preliminiaries and setting up some of the first steps for creating the Hangman game. Namely, we will be using our new-found UI knowledge to create the View of the game.

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. ** Add to HangmanViewController.swift and Main.Storyboard **
4. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository.

## Requirements
1. Must have a "New Game" Button
2. Must have a "Guess Button
3. Must have a Textfield (where user enters letter as guess)
4. Must have a UILabel that indicates what guesses have been made. 
5. Must have an UIImageView that will represent the "state" of the man being hung.
6. You must create any necessary constraints for all subviews.

# Project 2: Hangman App

## Due
Monday, October 26 at 11:59 PM

## Description
In Homework 3, we gave you most of the basic logic for a functioning Hangman
game. As well, you built UI around the game. In Project 2, you'll be putting
everything together into a well-designed and fully-functional application.
Note that while many of the required features below have already been implemented
in Homework 3, some requirements have changed or been refined.

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain
   YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. **Create Hangman app**
  * Required
    * A "New Game" Button (to start a New Game)
    * A "Guess" Button (for the user to submit a Guess)
    * A method of guessing letters
    * A UILabel that indicates the incorrect guesses (on the same screen)
    * A square-dimensioned UIImageView that represents the "state" of the Hangman
    * Appropriate images for each "state" of the Hangman (we provide basic ones in /basic-hangman-img)
    * Use constraints - any and all views must scale to different devices
    * A working Hangman game
    * A win state, indicated by an Alert (Pop up box)
        * Should prevent additional guesses
    * A fail state, indicated by an Alert (Pop up box)
        * Should prevent additional guesses
    * A "Start Over" button
  * Optional
    * A smart way for the user to guess letters (since a Textfield with keyboard entry is bad UX)
        * Warning: Having a button for each letter is the natural choice. However, consider the
        difficulty of setting constraints on each button. Pursue at your own risk.
    * Customized images for each "state" of the Hangman
4. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository.
